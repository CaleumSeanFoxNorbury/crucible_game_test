TASK 1

We have given you a very basic PIXI setup which contains a simple index.html page and 2 JS files.
The first file is main.js and this is the entry point and also where the PIXI App is created.
The second file is game.js and this file creates 2 PIXI Containers and a simple button.

Whenever the button is pressed, we want you to add several boxes at random positions on the screen.
For the canvas dimensions, use the following: this.pixiApp.renderer.width and this.pixiApp.renderer.height
As each box is created, add it's reference to an array.

When the button is first pressed, ensure there are no boxes already on the screen by first checking the array.
If the array is not empty, run through each entry and remove each instance from the boxContainer using boxContainer.removeChild( //instance goes here ), then destroy each instance using .destroy(). Finally, empty the array.

So if it all works as planned, the first click will create and add boxes to the boxContainer (and array).
The second click will remove all of the boxes that have been added and destroy them.
The third click would start the process over from scratch....and so on.

- BONUS - Add some styling, randomise the square's colour?
